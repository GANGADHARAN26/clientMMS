## Authentication Implementation

The system implements a token-based authentication system using JWT:

1. **Login Process**
   - User submits credentials to `/auth/login` endpoint
   - Server validates credentials and returns user data and JWT token
   - Response format:
     ```json
     {
       "user": {
         "username": "johndoe",
         "email": "john.doe@example.com",
         "fullName": "John Doe",
         "role": "BaseCommander",
         "assignedBase": "Base Alpha",
         "_id": "60d21b4667d0d8992e610c85"
       },
       "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
     }
     ```

2. **Token Storage**
   - JWT token is stored in localStorage
   - Token is automatically included in all API requests as Bearer token
   - Format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - User logs in with username and password via `/auth/login`
   - Server returns a JWT token and user information
   - Token is stored in localStorage
   - All subsequent API requests include the token in the Authorization header
   - On logout, the token is removed from localStorage

4. **Token Validation**
   - On application initialization, the stored token is validated via `/auth/me`
   - If valid, the user session is restored with the returned user data
   - If invalid, the user is redirected to the login page

5. **Security Measures**
   - Automatic token removal on authentication errors (401)
   - Automatic redirection to login page on token expiration
   - Password change functionality with current password verification
   - Secure token handling in API requests

## API Integration

The system is fully integrated with the backend API as per the API documentation:

1. **Authentication API**
   - Login with username/password via `/auth/login`
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - User profile retrieval via `/auth/me`
   - Password management via `/auth/change-password`
   - Logout via `/auth/logout`

2. **User Management API**
   - User listing via `/users` with filtering and pagination
   - User details retrieval via `/users/:id`
   - User updates via `/users/:id`
   - User deactivation via `/users/:id` (DELETE)
   - Base-specific users via `/users/base/:base`

3. **Asset Management API**
   - Asset listing via `/assets` with filtering and pagination
   - Asset details retrieval via `/assets/:id`
   - Asset creation via `/assets`
   - Asset updates via `/assets/:id`
   - Asset deletion via `/assets/:id` (DELETE)
   - Base-specific assets via `/assets/base/:base`
   - Type-specific assets via `/assets/type/:type`

4. **API Request Format**
   - All requests include proper headers:
     ```
     Content-Type: application/json
     Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
     ```
   - Request bodies are formatted as JSON
   - Proper error handling for all API responses
