# Military Asset Management Frontend - Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **TanStack React Query Dependency Issues**
   - Removed React Query from the application since we're using mock data
   - Modified `_app.tsx` to remove the React Query Provider
   - Replaced API calls with mock data and simulated loading states

2. **Authentication Loading State Issue**
   - Modified the `AuthContext.tsx` to initialize with mock user data
   - Added a timeout to simulate API call and properly set the initialized state
   - Provided a mock login implementation for development

3. **Dashboard and Asset Pages**
   - Replaced React Query data fetching with mock data
   - Added simulated loading states with timeouts
   - Implemented proper error handling for the mock data

4. **Asset Detail Page**
   - Added mock data for asset details, transfers, purchases, assignments, and expenditures
   - Fixed the timeline component to handle empty arrays
   - Improved error handling for missing data

## Mock Data Implementation

We've implemented mock data for:
- User authentication
- Dashboard summary and charts
- Asset listings with filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Asset details with related transactions
- Transfers, purchases, assignments, and expenditures

## Development Notes

1. **Authentication**
   - The application now initializes with a mock admin user
   - Login functionality works with any username/password combination
   - Authentication state is properly managed in the Zustand store

2. **Data Fetching**
   - All API calls have been replaced with mock data
   - Loading states are simulated with timeouts to mimic real API calls
   - Error handling is in place for potential issues

3. **UI Components**
   - All UI components now work with the mock data
   - Charts, tables, and other visualizations display the mock data correctly
   - Forms submit to mock endpoints

## Next Steps

1. **API Integration**
   - When the backend is ready, uncomment the API calls in the services
   - Remove the mock data and simulated loading states
   - Update the authentication context to use real API endpoints

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Add integration tests for pages
   - Add end-to-end tests for user flows

3. **Optimization**
   - Implement proper data caching with React Query
   - Add server-side rendering for initial data loading
   - Optimize bundle size with code splitting
